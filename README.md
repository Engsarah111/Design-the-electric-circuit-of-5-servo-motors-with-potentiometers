Controlling servo motors for robot arm project with smart methods company

this is the electronic part of the robot arm project using 5 servo motors to control the joints of the robot arm using potentiometer in 90 degrees range

see the circuit connections of the servo motors with potentiometer in this file "Electric circuit .png "
